Overview
~~~~~~~~

Enhanced Edition games provide a feature to unlock numerous achievements in the course of advancing
the plot, finding powerful items or overcoming specific challenges. However, this feature is only
available if the game is played through the Steam client.

This mod detects unlocked achievements and makes them available as regular journal entries for
anyone playing the game without the need to use the Steam client.

The mod support all available Enhanced Edition games patched to version 2.0 or later, which
includes BGEE with or without SoD, BG2EE, EET, IWDEE and PSTEE.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the downloaded archive
into your game directory and run either "setup-A7-Achievements.exe" (Windows) or
"setup-A7-Achievements.command" (macOS). Follow the instructions and you are ready to start.

To uninstall, run "setup-A7-Achievements.exe" (Windows) or "setup-A7-Achievements.command" (macOS)
again and follow the prompts.

Note for Siege of Dragonspear (SoD):
GOG and Steam both install the "Siege of Dragonspear" expansion in a way that is not moddable out
of the box. You must install a mod called "DLC Merger" on your SoD installation before this or
any other WeiDU-based mods can be installed.
It can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest


Installation order & mod compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mod can be installed in any order. There are no known compatibility issues with other mods.
It is not needed to start a new game after installing the mod.


Components
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Install Steam Achievements as Journal Entries (for BG:EE, SoD, BG2:EE, EET, IWD:EE and PST:EE)

This component provides unlocked achievements are quest journal entries under the "Achievements"
category.

In EET the mod will include detection of BG:EE and SoD achievements even though they are not
covered by the underlying BG2:EE base installation.

In PST:EE the journal entries are added as "completed quests" to avoid cluttering the list of
active quests.

The component can be installed at any time. It is not needed to start a new game. Achievements that
have already been unlocked before the mod was installed will be detected and added to the journal.

In addition to the official Steam Achievements the mod also unlocks a small number of unused
achievements for SoD which are implemented in the game but not registered by Steam.

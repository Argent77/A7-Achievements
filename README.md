## Overview

Enhanced Edition games provide a feature to unlock numerous achievements in the course of advancing the plot, finding powerful items or overcoming specific challenges. However, this feature is only available if the game is played through the Steam client.

This mod detects unlocked achievements and makes them available as regular journal entries for anyone playing the game without the need to use the Steam client.

The mod support all available Enhanced Edition games patched to version 2.0 or later, which includes BG:EE (with or without SoD), BG2:EE, EET, IWD:EE and PST:EE.

## Components

### Install Steam Achievements as Journal Entries *(for BG:EE, SoD, BG2:EE, EET, IWD:EE and PST:EE)*

This component provides unlocked achievements are quest journal entries under the "Achievements" category.

In EET the mod will include detection of BG:EE and SoD achievements even though they are not covered by the underlying BG2:EE base installation.

In PST:EE the journal entries are added as "completed quests" to avoid cluttering the list of active quests.

The component can be installed at any time. It is not needed to start a new game. Achievements that have already been unlocked before the mod was installed will be detected and added to the journal.

In addition to the official Steam Achievements the mod also unlocks a small number of unused achievements for SoD which are implemented in the game but not registered by Steam.
